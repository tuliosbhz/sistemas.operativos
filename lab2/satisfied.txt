I have lost my appetite
And a flood is welling up behind my eyes
So I eat the tears I cry
And if that were not enough
They know just the words to cut and tear and prod
When they ask me "Where's your God?"
Why are you downcast, oh my soul?
Why so disturbed within me?
I can remember when you showed your face to me
As a deer pants for water, so my soul thirsts for you
And when I behold Your glory, You so faithfully renew
Like a bed of rest for my fainting flesh
I am statisfied in You
When I'm staring at the ground
It's an inbred feedback loop that brings me down
So it's time to lift my brow
And remember better days
When I loved to worship You and learn Your ways
With the sweetest songs of praise
Why are you downcast, oh my soul?
Why so distrubed within me?
I can remember when you showed your grace to me
As a deer pants for water, so my soul thirsts for You
And when I survey Your splendor, You so faithfully renew
Like a bed of rest for my painting flesh
I am ststisfied in You
Let my sighs give way to songs that sing about your faithfulness
Let my pain reveal your glory as my only real rest
Let my losses show me all I truly have is you
'Cause all I truly have is You
So when I'm drowning out at sea
And Your breakers and Your waves crash down on me
I'll recall Your safety scheme
You're the one who made the waves
And Your Son went out to suffer in my place
And to tell me that I'm safe
So why am I down?
Why so disturbed?
I am satisfied in You
I am satisfied in You
I am satisfied in You
I am satisfied in You
I am satisfied in You
